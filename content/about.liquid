        Hello, I'm Jorge García Hinestrosa, a computer science engineer born and raised in Almería but currently based in Barcelona, Spain. I work as a tech lead of the Smart TV team at <a href="https://filmin.es/" target="_blank">Filmin</a>.
      </p>
      <p>My professional experience goes from front-end Web development to more specific Smart TV development.</p>
      <p>At Filmin, my main focus over the last few years has been on leading a project that was initially developed by an external company and transform it into a fully in-house development initiative. This involved the implementation of necessary technology updates and new workflows for the entire team.</p>
      <p>During the previous years, I was developing video playback experience from the front-end side for video streaming services related to Smart TV platforms.</p>
      <p>Due to my Smart TV development experience, I have studied and integrated propietary video APIs from different manufacturers like Android TV, Samsung, LG, Panasonic, Philips or Vestel in multiple projects available in production for several countries.</p>
      <p>I always try to work on side projects since I can't really stay much time without programming. If you're interested on my work, please, take a look to my <a href="/projects">projects</a>.</p>
      <p>My interests have always been in computers, art and culture. This is why I mostly spend my spare time on watching films, reading books and taking photos. I also draw and paint. Take a look to my little <a href="/art" />art section</a> if you like.</p>
      <p>When I have time, I also enjoy playing video games. I like new games but I always go back to LucasArts, DOS and SNES games.</p>
      <p>In case you want to contact me, you can find me on <a href="https://mastodon.social/@jghinestrosa" target="_blank">@jghinestrosa</a> or you can send me an old fancy email to hello@jghinestrosa.com.</p>
