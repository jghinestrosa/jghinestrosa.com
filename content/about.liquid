        Hello, I'm Jorge García Hinestrosa, a computer science engineer born and raised in Almería but currently based in Barcelona, Spain. I work as a tech lead of the SmartTV team at <a href="https://filmin.es/" target="_blank">Filmin</a>.
      </p>
      <p>My professional experience goes from front-end Web development to more specific SmartTV development.</p>
      <p>My main focus in the last few years has been on developing video playback experience from the front-end side for video streaming services.</p>
      <p>Due to my SmartTV development experience, I have studied and integrated propietary video APIs from different manufacturers like Samsung, LG, Panasonic, Philips or Vestel in multiple projects available in production for several countries.</p>
      <p>I always try to work on side projects since I can't really stay much time without programming. If you're interested on my work, please, take a look to my <a href="/projects">projects</a>.</p>
      <p>My interests have always been in computers, art and culture. This is why I mostly spend my spare time on watching films, reading books and taking photos. I also draw with charcoal and pastels, specially portraits.</p>
      <p>As a 80s and 90s lover, it's easy to find me playing classic LucasArts adventure games, DOS games or SNES/NES/Game Boy cartridges.</p>
      <p>I recently started to skate again. I haven't practice for more than 15 years but <a href="/assets/ollie.jpeg">I still can ollie</a>.</p>
      <p>In case you want to contact me, you can find me on <a href="https://twitter.com/jghinestrosa" target="_blank">@jghinestrosa</a> or you can send me an old fancy email to hello@jghinestrosa.com.</p>
