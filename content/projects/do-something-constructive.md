Adventure games are one of my favourites game genres and this is partially due to the amazing work done by LucasArts during the 90s.

I can't remember the time I spent playing Day of the Tentacle, Loom, Sam and Max... and Monkey Island.

I love Monkey Island 1 and 2. I just loved the pirate theme and the kind of humor both titles had. Third part was ok but I think I missed the pixel art and [Ron Gilbert](https://grumpygamer.com/) too much.

Regarding to Monkey Island 2, every time I finished the game, I used to stare at the monitor and read all the messages that were printed once the game is done, telling you to turn off the computer and go to do something else.

I came up with a web that did exaclty this. Give you some ideas to do something constructive.

I kept the kind of black screen and purple font that the game used. You just have to click or tap to update the advice.
