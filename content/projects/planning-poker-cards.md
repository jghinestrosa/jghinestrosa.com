Just a simple web that shows a deck of cards for [planning poker](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planning_poker). I needed one for work and I decided to make my own.

The part I enjoyed the most was creating the cards design using only CSS, specially the pattern in the backside.

I had some problems with the scrolling performance and I think it's still there. I hope I can find some time to improve this.
