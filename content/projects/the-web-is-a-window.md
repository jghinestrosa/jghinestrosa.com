I always saw the web as a window through which we can access to unlimited resources, infinite knowledge and different point of views.

This window let us take a look to what is oblivious of our personal situation and be part of something bigger. A window through which we get in touch with other people and we can access to their ideas and opinions.

The web is a window through which you can express yourself.

The web as a medium, as a channel, as a window.

I decided to create an add-on that adds a SVG drawn window in the top of the page you're visiting. Trying to make you aware of the web as the window that it is.
