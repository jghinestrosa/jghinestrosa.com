I think this is the first game I made for the web. Maybe the first one I ever ~did~ finished.

I was working on a [maze generator](https://github.com/jghinestrosa/maze-generator) based on the Prim's algorithm and then I came up with the idea of creating a game based on mazes.

It's a very simple game where a random maze is generated every time and you can control a little rat to move through it. The goal is to reach the end of the maze and get a piece of cheese.

It was really fun to work on this since I always had interest on video games and how they are made. This was a good opportunity to learn more about collision detector, inputs handlers, spritesheets...

Remember to allow the web to play audio to enjoy the soundtrack that my friend [Antonio](https://antoniovm.com/) made! At the time it was implemented I think there was no restriction to play audio without user interactions.
